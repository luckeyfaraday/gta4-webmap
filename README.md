# GTA IV browser map prototype

This project reads the installed GTA IV archives locally and exports the complete
outdoor Liberty City map — 34 sectors across Manhattan, Broker/Dukes/Bohan and
Alderney — to a streaming Three.js viewer with Overview, Fly and Walk modes.
Rockstar assets remain local and are not included in the source code.

## Run

```powershell
cd "C:\Games\Grand Theft Auto IV - The Complete Edition\_webmap"
npm install
npm run serve
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:4174>.

## Rebuild the map

```powershell
npm run extract:world   # all 34 outdoor sectors + web/assets/world.json
npm run extract         # single proof sector (manhat01) only
```

The extractor reads each sector's `.img`, its base/streaming WPL placements,
WDR/WDD models, and WTD texture dictionaries. It writes an instanced,
Meshopt-compressed glTF scene per sector plus a deduplicated cache of the
original DDS texture mip chains shared across every sector.

Texture lookup is engine-faithful: GTA IV's `pgDictionary` hash table is keyed on
the bare leaf name with no extension (`road4cobble`), not on the stored
`pack:/road4cobble.dds` spelling. Verified against all 50,663 texture entries
under `pc/`.

## Checks

```powershell
npm test                        # browser smoke test -> artifacts/*.png
node test/probe-white.mjs       # per-pixel material/texture audit of the view
```
